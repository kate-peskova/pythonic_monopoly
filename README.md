SFO real estate analysis data frames and charts

The objective of the Pythonic Monopoly project is to analyze the San Francisco real estate. In this project, we retrieve the data from Census databases and Mapbox APIs. We then customize our own data frames and plot the charts.

The included plots and charts are:
* Housing Units Per Year
* Average Gross Rent in San Francisco Per Year
* Average Sales Price Per Year
* Average Prices by Neighborhood
* Average Prices by Neighborhood
* Top 10 Most Expensive Neighborhoods
* Comparison of Rent and Sales Prices of Most Expensive Neighborhoods
* Parallel Coordinates Plot
* Parallel Categories Plot
* Neighborhood Map

Once all the data is designed and plotted, we transport all the plots into a Dashboard to create a user-friendly interface.
